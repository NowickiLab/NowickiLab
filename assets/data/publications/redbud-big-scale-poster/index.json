We discovered presence of population structure, high genetic diversity, and moderate genetic differentiation between two major clusters of <em>C. canadensis</em> in the Southern Appalachia. The conclusion is, the species was able to maintain high levels of genetic diversity and spatial genetic structure, despite habitat fragmentation. Results of this study have implications for habitat management efforts and future breeding programs to improve desirable horticultural traits.</p>\n","validDateString":"2019-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[]}},"context":{}}
