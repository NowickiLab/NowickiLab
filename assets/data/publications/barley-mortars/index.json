The manuscript just got released to the <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy/special_issues/drought_mechanism\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Special Issue of Agronomy: Mechanism and Improvement of Drought Resistance in Crops</a>. </p>\n<p>We describe how 7 various seed treatments affect the barley seed physiology at the seedling stage under drought, and after reversal of the stress. Seed treatments help reduce the initial pathogen load and thus improve the condition of plants from their earliest developmental stages. But, they can have impacts beyond their basic role of fungicide protection.</p>\n<p>We tested 7 seed treatments, and they differed in their impacts on the vigor parameters of the barley seed and on the physiological state of seedlings under drought stress and after regeneration. Seed treatments based on the substances from the SDHI group did not cause inhibition of the seedling growth. Using the analysis of photosynthesis-related parameters, we showed that seed treatments from the SDHI group provided a superior tolerance of the imposed drought in spring barley than other treatments. In addition to protection against abiotic stress, SDHI treatments also rendered a higher efficiency of the photochemical reactions in the treated plants.</p>\n<p> I'm way beyond excited for this collaborative project hitting the press.</p>\n<p>  <img src=\"database%5Cpublications%5C2020%5Cagronomy-10-00731-ag.png\" alt=\"accepted\" title=\"Our paper&#x27;s gist (a.k.a. graphical abstract). \"></p>\n","validDateString":"2020-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","img":"","tags":[{"title":"photosynthesis","path":"/tag/photosynthesis/"}]}},"context":{}}
