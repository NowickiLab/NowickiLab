Yes, working remotely surely helped my productivity. Yes, limiting the meetings and occassional chats made their painful mark on my psyche - but also showed, how much can be actually done without disruptions of all sorts.</p>\n<p>So let's start off the list with development of <a href=\"https://nowickilab.science\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">this very website</a>: A major project to document my career's progress. It requires my frequent attention, but makes a great platform to share news and achievements. (also in this category: @LabNowicki)</p>\n<p>In 2020, I managed to publish <a href=\"publications%5C2020\">4 full-scale papers</a>, 2 more are submitted and 2 more are very close to that. Several papers in development ensure that I'm not bored. Perhaps most tellingly, my reads and <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tW2yveAAAAAJ&#x26;hl=en&#x26;oi=ao\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">citations</a> sky-rocketed in 2020 (see pic below).</p>\n<p>I was fortunate to push several research grant proposals, and was asked to join a PhD committee. Became an important contributor to <a href=\"https://www.pestinfo.org/contact.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Learned</a> <a href=\"https://ashs.org/page/Committees\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Societies</a> and <a href=\"https://eureca.utk.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">UT-bound</a> <a href=\"https://sasef.utk.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">activities</a>. Peer-reviewed 38 papers and a <a href=\"http://www.bard-isus.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">BARD</a> research grant proposal (CRAZY!).</p>\n<p>Research-wise, we're going strong with several cool <a href=\"projects\">projects</a>. On top of that, I've struck international co-operations with colleagues from Europe (more soon). And, we're collaboratively working towards tree genomes (more soon as well).</p>\n<p>What's in the red then?</p>\n<p>I did not get to much enjoy vacation this year beyond a weekend trip to Michigan (early March, before it hit the fan). I did not get to see my family nor friends. We had to cancel <a href=\"https://skiercon.pl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">our annual fantasy convention</a>. </p>\n<p> <img class=\"g-image g-image--lazy g-image--loading\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 973 779' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-4be0b9cee188b0c678f355876f196c71'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-4be0b9cee188b0c678f355876f196c71)' width='973' height='779' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAzAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGwAAAgMBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYBBAUCAwj/xAA3EAABAwIDBAgEBAcAAAAAAAABAgMRAAQFEiEGMVGRBxMUIkFSYXEWI4GyMzVz8DY3U3ShwcP/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8A%2bnJHEVw8V9Uvqspcju5jpNX8qfKOVGVPlHKgwesxULgMWZSPEukE/wCK6U7iQSMtvalUmfnECNI8PflW5lT5Ryoyp8o5UGKp3EOuhFvbdXmAzF0gx4mIq9I4irmVPlHKjKnyjlQU5HEUSOIq5lT5Ryoyp4DlQTHrRHrR%2b99H730BHrRHrUUi2O2z6tl8cxe6tGlHDrlTKWmlFOdIKRJJnXWge49ao45cuWWC390zHWsW7jqMwkSlJInlRY4izc2di84tDLl20lxDSliTKQYHGJpUuMffxRrbXD3WW0N4ewtDakkysFCt/Kg3tisTuMZ2Xw/ELzIH32ypeQQmcxGg%2blarzKnFoUHXEBJkhO4%2b9LnRf/AWD/pH7lUx3DTTimi6SClWZPeiT/ug9SUgEmABWFtTtJbYBhLd%2bWjdNLeSyA0obzOs/SqhvsUuMax2zuGmhhaLc9mcEZlry94HXwk%2bApIewTED0WYbhotj21u%2bDimsyZCcyjO%2bNxHOgdH8avEdJNtg6Vo7CuyL6k5BOaTrP0pCtv5Y7Z/36vvRTm/aPr6VLTEEImzTYlou5hAUZIETO6lu3wi%2bHR/tTZlg9purwuMt50ytJWkgjWPA8qC1iIHxB0cSB%2bB/zTXOH/mXSV%2bmr7F1dvsPul41sM6lqUWTIFwcw%2bWcqU668QRpXNnh903f7erW1Cb1tQtzmHzO6oaa8SBrxoN7owj4Cwef6R%2b5VMV12cFk3AQTnAbzCYV6etKeyFy7gexuCW1xaPOXGrTiG1IlvvEkmTECRunfTg4pKUhSgTqAIE7zQTlTr3Rr6UZU%2bUcqKKCcqZnKJ9qgITEZUx7UUUElKZnKJ9qjInXujlRRQGROndTpu0rqiig//9k=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e\" width=\"973\" alt=\"ScholarGoogle\" data-srcset=\"/assets/static/GS.82a2fbd.17c69bcbc1edb5fe994279748cff469f.jpg 480w, /assets/static/GS.2d99ec6.17c69bcbc1edb5fe994279748cff469f.jpg 973w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 973px) 100vw, 973px\" data-src=\"/assets/static/GS.2d99ec6.17c69bcbc1edb5fe994279748cff469f.jpg\"><noscript><img class=\"g-image g-image--lazy g-image--loaded\" src=\"/assets/static/GS.2d99ec6.17c69bcbc1edb5fe994279748cff469f.jpg\" width=\"973\" alt=\"ScholarGoogle\"></noscript></p>\n","summary":"What a year!!!","img":"","tags":[{"title":"academic life","path":"/tag/academic%20life/"},{"title":"science career","path":"/tag/science%20career/"},{"title":"publishing","path":"/tag/publishing/"},{"title":"research","path":"/tag/research/"}]}},"context":{}}
