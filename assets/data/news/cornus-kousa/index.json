The manuscript just got accepted to the <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/20457758\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Ecology and Evolution</a> and we're working on the final files and such. </p>\n<p>This is the first detailed report on <em>C. kousa</em> species diversity and evolutionary history inference. Asian dogwood is an east-Asia native tree, the most economically important species of the dogwood genus, owing to its desirable horticultural traits and ability to hybridize with North America-native dogwoods.</p>\n<p> To assess the species genetic diversity and to better inform the ongoing and future breeding efforts, we assembled an herbarium and arboretum collection of 131 non-cultivated <em>C. kousa</em> specimens. This is better than a collection trip across Asia - especially these days... This also indicates the strength of the current living and preserved plant collections.</p>\n<p> For genotyping and downstream analyses of our <em>C. kousa</em> collection, we developed the genic eSSRs and also used the published nuclear genomic gSSRs. After a blackbox of analyses, the study yielded insights into the species diversity. The data pointed to the species distinct genetic pools as per the plant country of origin. This can be helpful in the development of the commercial cultivars for this important ornamental crop with increased pyramided utility traits. </p>\n<p> To our knowledge, there are few studies utilizing the same gDNA collection to compare performance of genomic and genic microsatellites.</p>\n<p>Of note, this project <a href=\"https://eureca.utk.edu/photo-galleries/2018-event/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">won the 2018 EUReCA competition</a>, as delivered by our then-undergraduate research assistant, <a href=\"https://eureca.utk.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2018/05/EUReCA-2018-Program-for-web.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Logan</a>. He outcompeted more than 600 similar undergrad research presentations. Logan also won the within-UTIA leg of this competition. </p>\n<p>It is only proper, that this study report gets disseminated in such a reputable journal (DOI:10.1002/ece3.6537 ; to come out soon).</p>\n","summary":"Our paper on Asian dogwood species diversity accepted in Ecology and Evolution.","img":"","tags":[{"title":"dogwoods","path":"/tag/dogwoods/"},{"title":"plant species diversity","path":"/tag/plant%20species%20diversity/"},{"title":"population genetics","path":"/tag/population%20genetics/"},{"title":"evolutionary history","path":"/tag/evolutionary%20history/"}]}},"context":{}}
