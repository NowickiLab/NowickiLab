It was my first time ever to visit Annapolis, MD, and the first time to attend that meeting.</p>\n<p>We were excited to meet almost 200 people, all of them passionate about preserving the biodiversity, and passionate (but in completely different way) about the biological invasions that threaten it.</p>\n<p>Shiwani and I proudly presented a poster on the <em>Pyrus calleryana</em> diversity. This invasive callery pear is my main research focus these days. As a fundation for the downstream studies, we analyzed the native Asian samples, for an assessment of the species invasiveness potential. We appied <em>de novo</em> developed gSSRs and a series of population genetics tools.</p>\n<p>The results are fascinating.</p>\n<p>And scary.</p>\n<p>More soon.</p>\n<p>|||PICTURE of Shiwani and poster|||</p>\n","summary":"With my student Shiwnai Sapkota, we attended the exciting Forum on Invasive Species in Annapolis, MD","tags":[{"title":"invasive species","path":"/tag/invasive%20species/"},{"title":"USDA forum","path":"/tag/USDA%20forum/"}]}},"context":{}}
