It was first time ever to visit Annapolis, MD, and the first time to attend that meeting.</p>\n<p>We were excited to meet almost 200 people, all of which  passionate about preserving biodiversity, and passionate (but in completely different way) about the biological invasions that threaten it.</p>\n<p>Shiwani and I proudly presented a poster on the <em>Pyrus calleryana</em> diversity. This invasive callery pear is my main research focus these days. As a fundation for the downstream research, we analyzed the native Asian samples, for assessment of the species invasive potential. We appied <em>de novo</em> developed gSSRs and a series of population genetics tools.</p>\n<p>The results are fascinating.\nAnd scary.\nMore soon.</p>\n<p>|||PICTURE of Shiwani and poster|||</p>\n","summary":"With my student Shiwnai Sapkota, we attended the exciting Forum on Invasive Species in Annapolis, MD","tags":[{"title":"news","path":"/tag/news/"},{"title":"lorem","path":"/tag/lorem/"}]}},"context":{}}
