Trigiano</a>â€™s laboratory. I came to <a href=\"https://ag.tennessee.edu/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">UTIA</a> from the <a href=\"http://www.inhort.pl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Research Institute of Horticulture (Skierniewice, Poland)</a> where I spent six years (2010-2016) studying molecular background of (a)biotic stress responses in economically important plants. </p>\n<p>I held one post-doctoral position before that (joint Max-Planck Institute for <a href=\"https://www.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/2168/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Molecular Plant Physiology [Golm, Germany]</a> and <a href=\"https://prl.natsci.msu.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Michigan State University</a> in 2006-2009). My primary teaching responsibilities in the past were Cell Biology and Biochemistry and lab mentoring of the students.</p>\n<p>I received my Ph.D. at the Technical University Aachen (RWTH Aachen, Germany) under the supervision of <a href=\"http://www.bio1.rwth-aachen.de/SpecialBotany/team.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Prof. Dr. Margrit Frentzen</a> in the Institute for Botany / Unit of Special Botany. </p>\n<p>My research program at <a href=\"https://epp.tennessee.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">EPP</a> has largely focused on functional, population, and evolutionary studies of plants and their pathogens.</p>\n<p>Mentoring is a critical link between my research, teaching, and outreach activities. I have mentored several colleagues both in the formal setting and in the lab (under/graduate students and postdocs). Drawing from my personal history, I am committed to empowering the underrepresented groups in STEM.</p>\n<p>|||PICTURE?|||</p>\n","tags":[]}},"context":{}}
