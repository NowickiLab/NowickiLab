I joined the [Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology](https://epp.tennessee.edu) in October 2016 to work as postdoctoral Research Associate in [Dr. Robert N. Trigiano](https://epp.tennessee.edu/people/directory/dr-robert-trigiano/)â€™s laboratory. I came to [UTIA](https://ag.tennessee.edu/Pages/default.aspx) from the [Research Institute of Horticulture (Skierniewice, Poland)](http://www.inhort.pl) where I spent six years (2010-2016) studying molecular background of (a)biotic stress responses in economically important plants. 

I held one post-doctoral position before that (joint Max-Planck Institute for [Molecular Plant Physiology [Golm, Germany]](https://www.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/2168/en) and [Michigan State University](https://prl.natsci.msu.edu) in 2006-2009). My primary teaching responsibilities in the past were Cell Biology and Biochemistry and lab mentoring of the students.

I received my Ph.D. at the Technical University Aachen (RWTH Aachen, Germany) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Margrit Frentzen](http://www.bio1.rwth-aachen.de/SpecialBotany/team.html) in the Institute for Botany / Unit of Special Botany. 

My research program at [EPP](https://epp.tennessee.edu) has largely focused on functional, population, and evolutionary studies of plants and their pathogens.

Mentoring is a critical link between my research, teaching, and outreach activities. I have mentored several colleagues both in the formal setting and in the lab (under/graduate students and postdocs). Drawing from my personal history, I am committed to empowering the underrepresented groups in STEM.
