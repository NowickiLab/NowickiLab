## Well done, Trinity!

Friday morning we were all excited to hear the MS proposal seminar. Trinity Hamm (student from Dr. Trigiano's lab; I'm on her MS committee), shared with us many insightful details about [her MS project](database\projects\Redbud-chlorotyping.md).

If you are not sure what haplotyping is, do not know the importance of redbuds, or are jsut a Curious George, we have the answers!

Trinity delivered a great seminar.
