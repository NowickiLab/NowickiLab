## Thank you for the 2020 music!

What a year it was!

In my hitherto career (given, it's still at its baby steps), I never had such a productive year. Yes, working remotely surely helped my productivity. Yes, limiting the meetings and occassional chats made their painful mark on my psyche - but also showed, how much can be actually done without all sorts of disruptions.

So let's start off the list with development of [this very website](https://nowickilab.science): A major project to document my career's progress. It requires my frequent attention, but make sa great platform to share news and achievements. (also in this category: @LabNowicki)

In 2020, I managed to publish 4 full-scale papers
