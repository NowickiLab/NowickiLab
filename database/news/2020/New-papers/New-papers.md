## 1st paper out in 2020
Recent global events did affect us, but work from home goes on.
So, the shoutout to Meherafroze Ony, recent MS from Dr. Hadziabdic's lab, for becoming a published scientist!

In her thesis, Meher analyzed species-wide diveristy of Easter Redbud (_Cercis canadensis_ L.), at two levels: at fine scale in the Southern Appalachia region, and across the species native range (roughly, __half of lower US__).

The first report on the fine-scale analyses [was recently published](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.6141) in the reputable [Ecology and Evolution](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/20457758) (OpenAccess, so everyone's welcome!). The second report is to be submitted shortly.

Meher is a great storyteller, as this paper exemplifies (and __SPOILER__ so does the second __SPOILER__). In short, despite habitat fragmentation and loss (=differentiation), at fine-scale the species managed to retain high levels of diversity.

But, you really need to read all that yourselves!
